	abstract = {Over the course of the Spring semester of 2021, we attempted to integrate support for LORD IMUs into the Ardupilot autonomous flight software suite. We did this for school credit here at CSU, as an independent study in partnership with the CSU Drone Center. A good portion of the semester was spent on research and study, as most of the technologies and existing libraries that we worked with were new to us. After lots of learning, we began development and testing of custom Ardupilot builds on a Pixhawk 4 with a LORD 3DM-CX5-45 IMU. By the end of the semester, we completed one test flight, in which we successfully launched and flew a fixed-wing aircraft in autonomous mode using our custom Ardupilot build, which used accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, and magnetometer data from only the LORD IMU, with the Pixhawkâ€™s built in IMU completely disabled. There is still much work to be done to get our modifications to Ardupilot production ready, and we hope to continue work on this project in the future.},
